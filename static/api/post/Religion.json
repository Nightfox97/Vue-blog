    "content": "There is considerable scholarship on relationships between law and religion in India, which has followed various lines of enquiry. Authors have pointed out the legacy of British policies in taking over the management of religious institutions in the name of administrative rationalization; the history and political consequences of Private Laws; the Constitutional protection and regulation of the freedom of religion (Articles 25 and 26); the role of the Courts in implementing this Constitutional mandate; or the reformist agenda that some judges may try to promote. In the first part of this paper I sum up the aspects of these studies that mainly pertain to politics of secularism concerning Hindu temples. Then, in a second section, I turn to the comparatively less explored issue of the impact on religious practices of the mere imposition of legal categories and requirements. How does the legal process by itself and beyond any particular policies, beyond even a secularist agenda, shape religious practices (Hindu, Muslim, Christian)? While acknowledging that such legal 'determinism' is completely entangled in general policies or judges’ personal values, I nevertheless wish to point out a few systemic properties of modern law that have a decisive effect in shaping religion—although my argument also applies to Islam and Christianity, my study focuses on Hinduism.",
