    "content": "Man and woman both are equal and play a paramount role in the creation and development of their families in a particular and the society in general. Indeed, the struggle for equality has been one of the major concerns of the womenâ€™s movement all over the world. The difference in sex and physical form denotes no difference in status. Woman is the complement of man, and not inferior. In India, since long back, women were considered as an oppressed section of the society and they were neglected for centuries. The birth of the son is being celebrated while the birth of a daughter is filled with pain. Boys are encouraged to be tough and outgoing but girls are encouraged to be homebound and shy. All these differences are gender differences and they are created by society. It has adverse impact on development goals and consequently reduces economic growth. It hampers the overall well-being because blocking women from participation in social, political and economic activities can adversely affect the whole society. Gender inequality is, therefore, a form of inequality which is distinct from other forms of socioeconomic inequalities. Gender inequality in India is a crucial reality. In modern times, women are performing exceptionally well in different spheres of activities.",
