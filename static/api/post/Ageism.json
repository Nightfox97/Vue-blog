    "content": "In the modern and rapidly evolving Indian workplace, though, using such honorifics for senior colleagues may seem anachronistic – perhaps even hypocritical. Particularly when older workers increasingly face subtle, and often not-so-subtle, age discrimination.\n\nWhile young people with the appropriate number of Instagram followers are seen as role models, experience is turning into a liability. Most senior executives told me they fear being seen as slower, change-resistant, expensive, and ultimately even useless.\n\nOne of the big reasons for the creeping ageism is the Indian media’s unabashed focus on the age of new tech entrepreneurs, many of whom started up in their early to mid-20s.The corollary of this obsession with youthfulness is the gradual distancing from middle-aged executives, mostly viewed as costly and antiquated. Such disdain for the older is palpable even among millennials down the ladder. Even the threshold age for old has decreased rather drastically with each passing generation.",
