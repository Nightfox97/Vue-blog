    "content": "The Education system of a country does not function in isolation from the society of which it is a part.  Hierarchies of castes, economic status, gender relations and cultural diversities as well as uneven economic development also deeply influence issues relating to access and equity in education. Our society has been characterized with deeply entrenched social inequalities between various social groups and castes since ancient times.  Though India was widely acclaimed as a land of knowledge and wisdom during ancient times yet access to education was limited to select strata of the society.  The marginalized groups of the society were subjected to social and economic oppression.  These centuries old social prejudices and inequalities, based on caste at birth, continue to dog the modern Indian landscape.  Extending educational opportunities to the marginalized groups was considered an antidote to this longstanding discrimination.  Several attempts have been made by social reformers and others to make education accessible to these marginal groups with varying degree of success.",
